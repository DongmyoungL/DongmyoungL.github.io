My research interest is fundamentally based on gripper design and control for deformable object manipulation using a single robot arm, which includes bimanual cloth manipulation and organic object manipulation.

### Research Interest
* Dexterous Griper Design and Robot Manipulation
  * Design and control of versatile robotic grippers for complex tasks such as deformable object manipulation.
* Multi-modal Perception and Control
  * Integration of vision and tactile data for robust perception and feedback for precise manipulation tasks.
* AI-Driven Robotic Systems
  * Application of AI techniques, including generative models and foundation models for robust control in cluttered environment.
* Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
  * Research on haptic interfaces, motion capture, and control algorithms for intuitive human-robot collaboration in domestic and industrial applications.

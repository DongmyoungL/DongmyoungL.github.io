### üîç Research Interests

My research is fundamentally centered on **gripper design and control for deformable object manipulation using a single robotic arm**, encompassing applications such as **bimanual cloth manipulation** and **organic object handling**. I pursue robust, generalizable robotic solutions through interdisciplinary approaches across design, control, perception, and AI.

- **Dexterous Gripper Design and Robotic Manipulation**  
  Design and control of versatile robotic grippers capable of complex tasks, including deformable object manipulation with a single arm.

- **Multi-Modal Perception and Control**  
  Integration of vision and tactile sensing for robust perception and closed-loop feedback control in precise manipulation tasks.

- **AI-Driven Robotic Systems**  
  Leveraging AI techniques‚Äîincluding generative models and foundation models‚Äîto enhance manipulation performance in unstructured and cluttered environments.

- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**  
  Development of intuitive human-robot collaboration frameworks through haptic interfaces, motion capture, and shared autonomy for both domestic and industrial applications.

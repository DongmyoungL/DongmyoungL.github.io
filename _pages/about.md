I am a PhD student at [Robot Intelligence Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr. Petar Kormushev](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/p.kormushev) and [Dr. Nicolas Rojas](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.rojas). 

My research interest includes (i) gripper design and control for dexterous manipulation of deformable object, (ii) multi-modal perception and control, (iii) AI-driven robotic systems, and (iv) Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). 

If you have any questions that I can help with, please feel free to reach out here on Linkedin or via email at d.lee20@imperial.ac.uk.
